  # Installation
   I had to use Node.js and install from the npm the module ```express```, 
   plus an installation of *Heroku* is required if you want to deploy your own notebook.
   If not then you can navigate to this page ‚û°Ô∏è [live page](https://shrouded-retreat-68338.herokuapp.com) 
   ...and make a bookmark or install it from your Brower. 

  # Usage
    This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
